We moved to London for work so I guess I missed the memo. Unaware, we went for breakfast when we were in town a few weeks ago. As soon as we were seated I ordered my (what I thought was going to be first of many) White Peach Pear Iced Tea. Big smile on my face - London has great hot tea but crap iced tea...you really have to make it yourself usually over here. At any rate - denied. 
Waitress: ""Uh we don't have that any more."" 
Me: (checking the menu in disbelief, mouth agape in horror) ""What?!?"" 
Her: ""Yeah, like, I don't know why they did it...it was really popular."" 
Me: (suspicious it might actually be my own fault given how many refills I always ordered and how often we frequented Turning Point): ""Yeah, doesn't make sense"" 
My husband: (impatient and not trying to be helpful despite whatever he says) ""Just order something else""
Me: (withering glare putting him on notice...thinking that iced tea is the ONLY reason I come to Turning Point so often) ""You order first""

After trial and error I found you CAN order the (available as hot only) White Orchard tea with two accompanying glasses of ice and make your own. But, hell, I might as well be eating breakfast in London slopping the whole table up with tea drippings and condensation. Plus I miss the pure joy of having a perfect White Peach Pear Iced Tea in a takeaway cup to savor while my husband is dawdling his way across Home Depot or something.

First thing you see when you walk in is the espresso bar. They have French press options on the menu as well as espresso and the unlimited house coffee options to fill the range of tastes and budgets.

I ordered the huevos rancheros, which came in top of a plate sized tortilla which might have been able to hold itself together as a huge breakfast burrito. If you don't know what huevos rancheros is, think of it as a typical American breakfast of eggs, home fries and sausages (this case chorizo) topped with salsa. In this case they also had a half of an avocado and sour cream. Tasty.

Wife has acai berry crepes which were a special. And we ordered two pancakes for the kid. The pancakes weren't special at all, but they weren't bad.

I had high hopes for this eatery but I got over that with just one visit. Arrived a little after 12p.m. on a perfectly lovely day with four other adult family members. The restaurant makes a nice impression with it's white beadboard trim and large windows. I'm thinking this is going to be nice. We were seated fairly quickly once they had converted a square table to round to accommodate our party of five. The waitress was friendly and attentive at first. Took our orders, poured our beverages etc. Tick, tock, it took 45 minutes before our food was served! If 5 is a big party, they are in big trouble. But the fun doesn't stop there. Out of 5 entrees there were 3 errors. Mom asked for sausage, she got bacon, Sister asked for multi grain bread, she got sour dough, hubby ordered a Tuscany omelet and got a Western. My tuna melt was accurate but miserably cold. Okay let's go with 4 out 5. My brother-in-law was happy with his Cuban. We're still trying to figure out how that happened. My advice, skip it!!!",2017-09-09 22:05:11,"got, asked, nice, took, party"

My french press coffee came out quickly but that was the only thing that was quick.  After 30+ minutes our meals came out and during that time neither of the girls behind the counter checked on our drinks or gave us an update on our food.  After speaking with several other people it seems the long wait times are the norm.  Hopefully they will work the kinks out since they are fairly new.

I had the Big Easy Benedict - Cornbread topped with avocado, creole seasoned onions, peppers and chorizo. Topped with poached eggs and cajun hollandaise.  The corn bread was awesome and I would give the entire meal a solid B.

My wife had the Fruity Chicken Salad - Two scoops of homemade chicken salad accompanied by California raisins, fresh seasonal fruit on a layer of baby spinach leaves with an english muffin.  The Chieck Salad was good but she thought the portion was small.

If I was just reviewing the food I would give it 3 1/2 stars but the wait and service was so poor I had to bring the overall rating to 2.  I will return and see if the service improves.",2017-05-30 13:24:32,"counter, came, wait, food, salad"

We were seated promotly and waited over 50 minutes for breakfast items we ordered. 50 minutes for breakfast and being told the kitchen is really backed up. I could have had our 4 items we ordered done in 10 minutes especially in a commercial kitchen and I am far from a chef. I ordered the basic skillet. Potatoes were over salted and this dish comes with eggs that were over cooked after asking for over easy created an extremely dry dish. Manager comped our meal but was not very friendly. Felt very sorry for our waiter. He was stuck in the middle.  Other breakfast items were only okay and really nothing to rave about. If this place survives I will be amazed unless they change their kitchen crew. Breakfast really is not that difficult or that hard to make. If you fail miserably at making breakfast you probably will not do well at asking anything more difficult.,2017-05-21 19:45:17,"breakfast, items, minutes, really, ordered"

After waiting we were finally seated and ordered our meal, only to end up sitting for over 50 mins with no food. I went up to talk to the manager, to try and explain how the other table seated much later were able to get their food before us. My husband left church early just to spend time together and had to return back, so we were trying to accommodate. But instead of apologizing and showing signs of concern, the manager's first comment was ""I can pack in to-go box"". We sat for 1 full hour! Really?

So when the food came out, we returned the Reuben sandwich, since my husband was now gone, and upset. 

When we asked for the bill, I got a check for all three orders which was taken care by ""Manger Comp"". 

I understand mistakes can happen. But the way the manager dealt with our situation, was very unkind. He should have been more polite and accommodated us more professionally. It was my first time, and I will probably not go back to this place again, unless they have a more established system working around it. 

We went in there with happy mood, sat there waiting for our food for an hour miserably, only to decide to simply eat and go. The ""comp"" check that was brought to us by the server, and not by the manager himself made it that much more upsetting.  This made myself and my daughter feel upset and we left with a sour feeling about the whole place. 

I plan to take this up to the corporate manager about how we were served by the server and about how things were handled by the manager!  Terrible first time experience here!!!",2017-05-21 19:10:32,"manager, food, first, went, time"

Once we were seated, I notice that the table was wobbling and it spins.  I informed the waitress about the table.  She couldn't do anything about it.  When we got our coffee, I realized that she forgot to give us spoons for the coffee. Finally, our food came. Again, I realized that she forgot to give us our utensils to eat the food.  I had to walk to the front and inform the hostesses that we had no utensils.  Everyone got their food except me.  The chicken with waffles took forever the make.
